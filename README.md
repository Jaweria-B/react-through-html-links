# **React Through HTML Links**

## **Overview**  
This repository contains simple examples demonstrating how to use React through HTML links. By directly including React and Babel libraries via CDN, you can create small React applications without needing a complex build process or toolchain setup.

## **Contents**

1. **`counter.html`**  
   - A React-based counter app that increments the count with each button click.  
   - Demonstrates state management using `useState`.  

2. **`hello.html`**  
   - A simple React component that greets multiple users.  
   - Explores the use of props for passing data into components.  

3. **`react.html`**  
   - A minimal "Hello!" example using React.  
   - Showcases how to render basic content with React.  

4. **`scroll.html`**  
   - A non-React example demonstrating how to change the background color dynamically as the user scrolls.  
   - Highlights how React can integrate with native JavaScript for event-driven interactions.

## **Why Use React Through HTML Links?**  
- **No Build Tools Required:** Start coding immediately without setting up tools like Webpack or Vite.  
- **CDN Links:** React and Babel are loaded directly from CDNs, simplifying the process.  
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Ideal for learning React concepts without the overhead of a full project setup.

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Add examples for more advanced React features like `useEffect`, conditional rendering, and lists.  
- Explore using JSX transformations with Babel for deeper understanding.  
- Include examples integrating React with external libraries.
